## Welcome to MedAware . We bring to you Better Health, More Awareness!!
# MedAware

A Disease Diagnosis portal powered by machine learning trained models. We harness power of the flourishing AI/ML to provide accurate and reliable disease prediction. 

Health related problems have and their checkups have never been affordable. We want to be the place that becomes first stop before the hospital. Also, it a solution for those who find there body a bit out of order. They, may get their diagnostic results here and based on that proceed accordingly.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  * Clone the repository on your local system.
  * Open the folder in VS Code. Then open a new terminal
  * Note: use python and pip in Windows and python3/pip3 in Mac

  In Terminal:

  virtalenv venv 
  windows: venv/Scripts.activate mac: venv/bin/activate
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  python main.py

  Now open localhost:3000 on your browser 
```


## Problem Statement
In the current healthcare landscape, accessing affordable and accurate disease prediction tools remains a significant challenge. There is a growing need for an accessible web application which utilizes AI and ML technologies to predict various diseases such as heart conditions, liver disorders, diabetes, and even infectious diseases like COVID-19. 

The problem arises from the lack of easily accessible and affordable disease prediction tools for individuals. Many individuals may be unaware of their health conditions until symptoms manifest, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, the cost associated with hospital visits and specialized tests can be prohibitive for certain individuals, further exacerbating the issue. Existing disease prediction models often require complex medical expertise or expensive diagnostic tests, making them inaccessible to the general public. Consequently, individuals may not have the necessary information to take proactive measures for their health, leading to increased healthcare costs and potentially avoidable complications.

## Our Solution
MedAware aims to become the go-to platform for individuals seeking reliable and cost-effective healthcare solutions before considering a visit to the hospital.
MedAware, which utilizes AI and ML technologies to predict various diseases such as heart conditions, liver disorders, diabetes, and even infectious diseases like COVID-19. 

Existing disease prediction models often require complex medical expertise or expensive diagnostic tests, making them inaccessible to the general public. Consequently, individuals may not have the necessary information to take proactive measures for their health, leading to increased healthcare costs and potentially avoidable complications.

The MedAware web application aims to address this problem by providing an accessible and user-friendly platform for disease prediction. By leveraging AI and ML techniques, MedAware can analyze a set of user-provided health data, including medical history, symptoms, and vital signs, to predict the likelihood of various diseases accurately. By empowering individuals with this information, they can make informed decisions about seeking medical care, adopting preventive measures, or managing their health conditions effectively.

By asking user for data and adding the right ones into our model we want to increase our training data. By increasing our dataset we can keep tuning the ML model. This will make our project robust scalable therby an ever evolving medical health detector/predictor which can become the first step before the costly hospital option.

The main objective is to create a more scalable, robust and evolving model. The present model we made do predict the diseases but the input parameter at present are not completely elementary. There are a few fields for which you need a few checkups. We want to keep simplifying the input parameters so that we can reach out to more and more people and make better user-experience. We also do plan to make more such model for other disease prediction.

Overall, MedAware strives to democratize healthcare by providing an affordable and reliable disease prediction solution that can be accessed conveniently by anyone. By becoming a trusted resource for disease prediction, MedAware aims to reduce healthcare costs, promote early detection of diseases, and enhance the overall well-being of individuals, establishing itself as the go-to platform for individuals seeking a preliminary health assessment before considering a visit to the hospital.
